                    An English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his
                    time as a "natural philosopher") widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of
                    all time and among the most influential scientists.

            Sir Isaac Newton was one of the greatest scientists and mathematicians that ever lived. He was prematurely born
            in England, on December 25, 1643 after his father's death. When Galileo died in 1642, Isaac Newton was born. He
            lived for 85 years. Newton had a difficult childhood. His mother remarried when his father died, when he was
            just three, and he was then sent to live with his grandparents. There he was raised by his grandmother. After
            his stepfather died, his mother brought him home to Woolsthorpe in Lincolnshire, where she wanted him to become
            a farmer. An uncle recognized his scholarly talents, however, and he eventually made it to Trinity College in
            Cambridge. From then on he became very talented and smart each day. He wrote his ideas in a journal. And one of
            these ideas was about gravity. But sadly he died in March 20,1727 due to a bladder stone. He is known as the
            Ftaher of Physics and we consider him to be the Father of modern science due to his numerous and varied
            discoveries.
